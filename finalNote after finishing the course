--------------------- parts which didnt function ---------
- AWS EC2
        - accessing mobile-app-ws from amazon is not working after deploying the WAR
- Some tests are failing
        - Repository test are failing when running together so i disabled the whole test calss of Repository

- In postman when trying to get a single user data, it is displaying lots of userdetails instead of a single user data
    - unable to parse json is the error.

- some tests are failing because "onApplicationEvent(ApplicationReadyEvent event)" supposed to run before the application starts and the tests are running without
getting any info from this method and "for example create user always fails because there is no role assigned to the new user."
there should be a way to assign a role to user befoer this test method starts so that user can have a role.


 ------------------------- some sql comannds usesed while implementing roles and authorities
 SELECT * FROM USERS ;
 select * from users_roles;
 select * from roles;
 select * from roles_authorities;
 select * from authorities;


-------------------------------- H2 in memory database is active and MySQL server is commented-----
- if needed enable the mySQL server and save data constantly.
