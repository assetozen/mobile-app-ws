------------------ Stash ------------------
# Assume the latest commit was already done
# start working on the next patch, and discovered I was missing something

# stash away the current mess I made
git stash save

# some changes in the working dir

# and now add them to the last commit:
git add -u
git commit --amend

# back to work!
git stash pop

# if stashed for example twice then check the stash lists and pop twice
git stash list
git stash pop
git stash pop
